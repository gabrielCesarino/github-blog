                    Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but
                    these often differ from one language to another. This article
                    attempts to list the built-in data structures available in
                    JavaScript and what properties they have. These can be used
                    to build other data structures. Wherever possible, comparisons
                    with other languages are drawn.
